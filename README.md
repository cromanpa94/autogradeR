# gradeR
## A package to simplify basic grading taks in `R`

`gradeR` is expected to help instructors grade pre-defined assignments using a particular and relatively simple set of functions.

-------------

## Installing `gradeR`

The `gradeR` R package can be installed from GitHub using the code presented below. I expect `gradeR` to be available on CRAN at some point in the future.

```
